# Why data visualization?

.pull-left[

### A new method for the DS toolbox

- Data visualization is a method for making sense (and not just pictures) of data.
- Note that this is more than data visualization in the narrow sense, i.e. the act of encoding quantitative information in visual objects.
- Data scientists are mostly interested in patterns, not individual and exact values.
- Two ways to make sense of quantitative information:

### The case for visualization

- Visualization **provides useful summaries** for large, complicated data sets – in fact, the utility of visualization increases with data size.
- Visualization **lets you see things** that would otherwise be invisible, in particular relationships among data (patterns, trends, exceptions). 
- Visualization comes with **little or no assumptions** about the nature of the data.
- Visualization facilitates interaction between researcher and data – **it’s a hypothesis generating device**.

<i> "The critical question is how best to transform the data into something that people can understand for optimal decision making." </i>
[Colin Ware, 2013](https://books.google.de/books?id=qFmS95vf6H8C&pg=PA5)

- One of the most famous data viusalizations of all times: [John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow)'s cholera case map.
- The [Broad Street cholera outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak) in in Soho, London in 1854 was studied by physician John Snow to study its causes (rival hypotheses: germ-contaminated water vs. airborne transmission).
- The germ theory was not established at this point but the map helped highlight how cases clustered around a contaminated pump (which was by far not the only source of contaminated water though).
- Fun fact: this is what doing good data viz gives you:

### Visualization as an iterative process

- The choice of the right graphical format ultimately depends on the task or problem it is trying to solve.
- Always try different graphical formats on the same data – they may reveal different aspects.
- Constructing visualizations is almost always an iterative process – the first graph is rarely also the final one.

### A tool for comparison

- "The fundamental analytical act in statistical reasoning is to answer the question 'compared to what?'
- Whether we are evaluating changes over space or time, searching big data bases, adjusting and controlling for variables, designing experiments, specifying multiple regressions, or doing just about any kind of evidence-based reasoning, the essential point is to make intelligent and appropriate comparisons.
- Thus visual displays, if they are to assist thinking, should show comparisons."

# Visual inference

.pull-left-wide[

### Human talent and weakness

- Humans are extremely good at recognizing patterns.
- At the same time, humans are also extremely good at inferring patterns when there are none (tendency to see patterns in random data = "apophenia").
- This is somewhat linked to the fact that our species is bad at dealing with probability and randomness.

### Concerns with exploratory data analysis

- A concern that frequently arises with exploratory analysis is that it lacks the rigor of formal tests in confirmatory analysis or conventional statistical inference.
- Long-standing reservations against visualization as merely "informal" approach to data analysis and the fear that beautiful pictures may in fact not correspond to any meaningful patterns of substantive scientific interest.

# Visual inference (cont.)

.pull-left[
### Overcoming the exploratory vs. confirmatory visualization divide

- Graphical displays are implicit or explicit comparisons to a reference distribution or baseline model.
- If we discover an interesting pattern in data this usually means that it looks different from what we expected.
- We usually we have implicit models in our mind to which we compare the data ("What do we expect to see?")
- We can make these models explicit and use them to guard against "false discoveries"
- Visual discoveries correspond to the implicit or explicit rejection of null hypotheses ([Buja et al. 2009](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2009.0120)).

.pull-right[
### Visual inference as an analogue to null hypothesis significance testing

The basic principle of formal testing remains the same in visual inference – with the exception that the test statistic is now a graphical display which is compared to a "reference distribution" of plots showing the null:

# Visual inference: the line-up protocol

This method is called "after the 'police lineup' of criminal investigations [...], because it asks the witness to identify the plot of the real data from among a set of decoys, the null plots, under the veil of ignorance" ([Buja et al. 2009](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2009.0120)).

The visual hypothesis test involves the following steps:

  1. Simulate data to create $m-1$ null plots.
  2. Randomly place the plot of the real data among them, resulting in a total of $m$ plots.
  3. Ask a human viewer to choose the plot that looks the most different from the rest.
  4. If the test person succeeds and picks the plot showing the actual data, then this visual discovery can be assigned a p-value of $1/m$. In other words, the probability of picking the true plot just by chance is $1/m$.

# Mapping data onto aesthetics

- Whenever we visualize data, we take data values and convert them in a systematic and logical way into the visual elements that make up the final graphic.
- Even though there are many different types of data visualizations, all these visualizations can be described with a common language. 
- All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as **aesthetics**.
- Key aesthetics are:

<div align="center">
<img src="pics/aesthetics.png" width=450>
</div>

- All aesthetics fall into one of two groups: Those that can represent continuous data (e.g., position, size, color) and those that can not (e.g., shape, line type).


---
# Coordinate systems and axes

.pull-left[
- Visualization of quantitative data requires a communication of quantities.
- Positions of data values matter. Usually, we need two position scales (x and y axis of the plot).
- The combination of a set of position scales and their relative geometric arrangement is called a **coordinate system**.
- Often we have two axes representing two different **units**. 
- In a **Cartesian** coordinate system, the grid lines along an axis are spaced evenly both in data units and in the resulting visualization.
- There are scenarios where nonlinear scales are preferred. In a nonlinear scale, even spacing in data units corresponds to uneven spacing in the visualization (e.g., log scales).
- Be sure to **label axes properly**!

# Fundamental principles of analytic design

In Chapter 5 of his book "[Beautiful Evidence](http://atc.berkeley.edu/201/readings/Tufte_BE_2006.pdf)", Edward Tufte outlines six fundamental principles of analytic design:

1. **Comparisons.** Show comparisons, contrasts, differences.

2. **Causality, mechanism, structure, explanation.** Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure.

3. **Multivariate analysis.** Show multivariate data; that is show more than 1 or 2 variables.

4. **Integration of evidence.** Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams.

5. **Documentation.** Thoroughly describe the evidence. Provide a detailed title, indicate the authors and sponsors, document the data sources, show complete measurement scales, point out relevant issues.

6. **Content counts most of all.** Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance and integrity of their content ("What is the problem you want to solve?")

On the following slide you'll see Minard's famous map of Napoleon's March, praised by Tufte as "one of the best statistical graphs ever". Can you spot how those principles were implemented in Minard’s Map? More information on the map [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard).

# Small multiples

.pull-left[
- A powerful yet underestimated visualization strategy is to use [multi-panel figures](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/multi-panel-figures.html).
- Often we want to compare relationships or trends between groups. With many groups, that's too much information for a single figure panel.
- There are various terms for multi-panel figures, including "small multiples" (Tufte 1990), "trellis plot" (Cleveland 1993) and "faceting" (Wickham 2016)
- In R we can implement this fairly easily with `ggplot`'s `facet_grid()` (or `facet_wrap()`).
- If you do small multiples, make sure to use:
  - common graph size
  - common axis scales
  - helpful alignment and order of panels

  - Ordered the countries by the most recent data point rather than alphabetically
  - Scale labels are found only on outer edge of the chart area, rather than one set per panel
  - Only used three labels for the 11 years
  - Did not overdo the vertical scale either

# Plotting things in R with ggplot2

.pull-left-wide[

`ggplot2` is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on *The Grammar of Graphics* (Leland Wilkinson). You provide the data, tell `ggplot2` how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details. It is part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).<sup>1</sup>

There are **many** key `ggplot2` verbs that you need to learn, including:

1. `ggplot()`: Begins a plot that you finish by adding layers to.

2. `aes()`: Specify aesthetic mappings that describe how variables are mapped to visuals (e.g., x and y).

3. `geom_*()`: Specify geoms to represent data points in a layer, e.g., as points or lines.
]

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> This is R, so you already know that there are multiple ways to do it, and all suck.<br>We will stay in the tidyverse and ignore R base graphics (`plot()`, `barplot()`, <br> `boxplot()`, `hist()`, etc.) for now.

# The grammar of graphics

.pull-left-vwide[
### The easy logic of graphical grammar

- Coding a graphic requires us to describe each element of it very precisely.
- To do so, `ggplot` and its creator [Hadley Wickham](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25651297.pdf) build on and extend a particular grammar - the "Grammar of Graphics" by [Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossmann](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532142).
- Building plots with `ggplot2` emphasizes the **concept of layers**, which are specified function by function and assembled with `+`.
- With this particular grammar, we talk less about chart *types* and more about specific chart *elements*.
- For instance, we don't say: 
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
  <i>"R, give me a small multiple scatter plot."</i>
  </div>
- Instead, we say: 
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
  <i>"Using this dataset, map wealth to the x-axis, health to the y-axis, add points, color by continent, size by population, scale the y-axis with a log, and facet by year."</i>
  </div>

# The grammar of graphics (cont.)

.pull-left-wide[
### The hard practice of applying graphical grammar

- Building basic plots is fairly straightforward with `ggplot2`.
- There are two aspects that make things complicated:
  1. `ggplot` expects tidy (long) data. That's not always the data structure you have.
  2. It's a comprehensive grammar. All the `ggplot` verbs, arguments and defaults are difficult to learn.
- Things become more complicated (but also exciting) with a multiverse of additional packages that bring additional geometrics, themes, aesthetics, and much more. Check out [this overview](https://github.com/erikgahner/awesome-ggplot2) to learn more.
- We will only touch the basics here. You will learn how to do the first steps in the lab. The rest is learning by doing.

# Components of grammar of graphics

| Element 	| Description 	| Essential? 	| Example 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Data 	| This is the dataset being plotted containing the variables to be plotted on the graph. 	| Yes 	| `ggplot(data = mpg)` 	|
| Aesthetics 	| Aesthetics refers to the scales on which we map our data. Some common aesthetics to consider are axis (x,y), shape, size and color.	|  Yes	| `aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)` 	|
| Geometries 	| Geom refers to the actual visual elements used for the data in the plot, such as points, lines, and bars. 	| Yes 	| `geom_point()` 	|
| Scales 	| Scales map data values to the visual values of an aesthetic. This can be used to change a default mapping 	| No 	| `scale_colour_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "green"))` 	|
| Facets 	| Faceting refers to splitting the data into multiple subsets and then displaying plots for the specific subsets in a panel (small multiples). 	|  No	| `facet_grid(vars(drv), ncol = 1)` 	|
| Statistics 	| This refers to representing statistical information about the data, such as mean and variance, to help in understanding the data.	| No 	| `stat_count(geom="bar")` 	|
| Coordinates 	| This refers to the space on which the data is plotted (e.g., Cartesian coordinates). 	| No 	| `coord_polar()`	|

# Picking the right image file format

.pull-left[
### What are the formats?
- At the end of the visualization workflow, you have to decide [how to store/export/publish the figures](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/image-file-formats.html).
- There are [many different file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats), but the most important difference is whether they are:
  - **Bitmap (raster graphics)**: store information as a grid of pixels
  - **Vector**: store information as geometric arrangement of individual graphical elements

### Which format to pick?
- Use `pdf/svg` whenever possible.
- Use `png` for online documents/presentations.
- Use `jpeg` as last resort (in particular if pngs are too large and loss by compression is acceptable).

# Going interactive

.pull-left-wide[
- In online presentations of your data and analyses, you might want to go interactive.
- Interactive webpages are mainly run with JavaScript, and we can use R to draw on JavaScript libraries to create interactive content.
- In particular, the `htmlwidgets` package provides a framework to bind R commands to various JavaScript libraries, including those that create data graphs.
- Many "widgets" are already available - check out http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/.
- Other JavaScript libraries for interactive graphics can be created with R, too:
  - [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) to connect to the [Leaflet library](https://leafletjs.com/) and create interactive maps
  - [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) to connect to [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/is-plotly-free/) and create graphs of all kinds
- For the record: interactive ≠ animated. On the right you see animated charts. Please don't do this at home.

# Some notes on the right visualization software

.pull-left[
1. Always conceptualize first.

2. Prioritize programmatic solutions to stay reproducible (i.e., R over Excel).

3. For conceptual charts (not: data viz!), other tools might be just fine (e.g., Powerpoint or even hand-drawn figures).

4. Don't be distracted by interactives (as offered by, e.g., highcharts.com, Tableau, and others).

5. Designing good graphs is a learnable skill. Study how others do it in your software of choice!

6. But a good visualization takes time, even if you’re experienced. Working a full day on the key plot of your analysis? No problem! If you go the coding route, this is a good investment for Future-You.
